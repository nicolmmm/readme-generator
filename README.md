# README Generator

This application allows users to create a high quality README markdown file for their applications straight from the command line. It prompts users for information about the application they are making such as the license, installation instructions, usuage, how to contribute and how to get in touch.

The application runs by calling the following command in the terminal.

```bash
node index.js
```

## File Naming

As I already have a README file in this application, for the output file will be called READMEexample. Users of this app can change the name of the output file to whatever they want in the index.js file on line 179 by changing the first arguement of the fs.writeFileSync function.
